---------------------------
THE FONTSPEC PACKAGE v2.0b1

This is the initial release of the fontspec package with support for LuaTeX.
(Previously, fontspec was XeTeX-only.)

The fontspec package provides an automatic and unified interface for loading
fonts in LaTeX. XeTeX and LuaTeX (the latter through the luaotfload package)
allows a direct interface to fonts which may be loaded by their name rather
than filename, so no manual font installation is required.

This package also provides access to the large number of font features
available with AAT and OpenType fonts, including upper and lower case numbers,
proportional and monospaced numbers, swash letters, ligature control, and many
others.

This package is developed at GitHub: <http://github.com/wspr/fontspec>
Please offer suggestions and file bug reports in the issue tracker:
  <http://github.com/wspr/fontspec/issues>


LuaTeX requirements
-------------------

TeXLive 2010 is recommended for running this package under LuaTeX.

This package requires the luaotfload package in order to load fonts in LuaTeX.
Version 1.08 or greater is recommended for this release. Please see
instructions in that package for font setup. That package, in turn, requires
a version of LuaTeX greater than that shipped with TeX Live 2009.


Summary of user commands
------------------------

Font families may be selected individually with the command

    \fontspec[<font options>]{<font name>}

Commands for selecting fonts efficiently can be created with

    \newfontfamily\myfamily[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \newfontface\myfont[<font options>]{<font name>}

Default document fonts are selected with

    \setmainfont[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \setsansfont[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \setmonofont[<font options>]{<font name>}

Fonts to be used in maths are defined with

    \setmathrm[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \setmathsf[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \setmathtt[<font options>]{<font name>}
    \setboldmathrm[<font options>]{<font name>}

Features to be used for every subsequently defined font are specified with

    \defaultfontfeatures{<default font options>}

Features may be added to the font currently in use with

    \addfontfeatures{<font options to add>}
    \addfontfeature{<...>} does the same thing

Features not provided for out of the box may be defined with

    \newAATfeature{<feature tag>}{<feature code>}{<selector code>}
    \newICUfeature{<feature tag>}{[+|-]<4 letter feature string>}
    \newfontfeature{<feature tag>}{<arbitrary XeTeX font options>}

Features can be renamed and feature options can be renamed with

    \aliasfontfeature{<current feature>}{<new feature>}
    \aliasfontfeatureoption{<feature>}{<current option>}{<new option>}



Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2008 or later, use 'tlmgr install fontspec'.
Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab euenc.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after, see your TeX
      distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.

5. For LuaTeX support you need luaotfload, it can be installed the same way.
